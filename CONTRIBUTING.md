We love pull requests.  We strive to promptly review them, provide feedback, and merge.  

A pull request MUST:

- pass all tests
- pass lint
- follow code style (4-space indents, maximum semicolons, single-quoted strings etc)
- update CHANGES.md (add a new version at the top if needed)
- be submitted by someone who has signed the [Contributor Licence Agreement](cla-assistant.io/TerriaJS/terria).
- be a named branch (not master) which merges cleanly with master

It SHOULD:

- add new tests
- address an issue in the issue tracker
- have JS-doc comments for public functions 

Consider also:

- adding test data into wwwroot/test that demonstrates new or improved features
