National Map
============

The National Map is a web based application developed by the National ICT Australia as part of an initiative of Department of Communications and working closely with Geoscience Australia. It is developed on top of existing open source software Cesium and Leaflet with WebGL and Canvas support.

It is designed to:
* Provide easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and public
* Facilitate the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies
* Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation

It is still very much proof of concept application, with revisions and releases occuring daily while we refine it.
