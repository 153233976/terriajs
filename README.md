AusGlobe
========

AusGlobe is a web based geo-browser that allows visualization of Geospatial
 data in a roughly similar fashion to Google Earth.  It connects to open
 data source OGC based geoservers via WFS, WMS, and WCS.
 
The goal of this project is to be open source when it releases, so all work
 should be carried out with that in mind.
