TerriaJS
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/TerriaJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/TerriaJS)

```
npm install terriajs
```

TerriaJS is a library for building rich, web-based geospatial data explorers.  It uses [Cesium](https://cesiumjs.org) for a full 3D experience.  Think Google Earth, except it runs in a web browser, without a plugin.  It also uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for a basic 2D experience on systems that can't run Cesium.

A live demo of an application built on TerriaJS can be found here:
[Australia's National Map](http://nationalmap.gov.au)

Instructions for incorporating TerriaJS into your application are coming soon.  In the meantime, see the GitHub repo for [Australia's National Map](https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap) for an example.
